# 🛣️ Accident Severity Prediction System  

This project predicts the **probability of a road accident being severe** based on factors such as weather, speed limit, road type, lighting, and more. It uses a **Random Forest Classifier** trained on traffic and environmental data, and includes a **Streamlit web interface** for interactive predictions.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
✅ Predicts accident severity probability using trained ML model  
✅ Handles missing values and categorical encoding automatically  
✅ Saves and reuses trained models (`.pkl` files) for fast inference  
✅ Easy-to-use web app built with **Streamlit**  
✅ Scalable — can be trained on new datasets

- **Python 3.9+**  
- **Streamlit** — UI for prediction  
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** — data manipulation  
- **Scikit-learn** — model training & evaluation  
- **Joblib** — saving/loading models
